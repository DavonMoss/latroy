these songs we like
hold you in time capsules
as you are now so could you always be
comes the high down made into memory

always ends
try to save
got no say in it anyway
now its gone
left me so high
and i moved on
but come bad days
i hit play when im missing you

still more to see
getting what i can from this body
spending what i cant though, honestly
least we can get it back though, not this

getting what i can from this body im in

from both sides
you look in
just sillhouettes
a million hands
all share the same feeling
this moment
you're lost in
its all the same

put this away it'll pick me up
when i need
i see your face everytime i listen to one of these

take this and know how to find what you've lost

nothing like this feeling like youre feeling
you got some people you don't treat like they deserve
hold em close just gotta love em when you see em [!]
you dont always have to try and find the words [!!]
