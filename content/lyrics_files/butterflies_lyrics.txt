since your life is mine i'll be real with you
i swallowed my pride once it changed my view
with limited time gotta just make do

average life this close
cap and gown i did those
butterflies i miss those

how long will you be scared to be who you are?
you choose yourself or you lose is all

its raining outside
you bum a smoke off a friend
the cold is biting your hands
you wont get home til the morning

3 o clock up lying in the bed
man you probably should've said something else
matter fact should've just said nothing

but i couldnt help it i had to say some
you got a fair chance you might as well try
aint no regret when its said and its done
you came alive when it mattered the most [!]

every time that you stop and give in
you fall in love with her over again
its way too easy to let go
make sure you dont
